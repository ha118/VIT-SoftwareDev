The code was written in java. The coe in its current state is incomplete and only works for level 1 of the problem.
The idea was to allow the user to check the probability of each of his shots and then make a decision.
To test the code, run the code and enter a value based upon the number of times you want to play.
The code will display the possible shots and their probabilities of success.
